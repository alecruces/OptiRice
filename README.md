### About the Project

This project explores semi-supervised learning using optimization methods for classifying rice seed types. We apply three optimization methods‚ÄîGradient Descent, Randomized Block Coordinate Gradient Descent (BCGD), and Gauss-Southwell BCGD‚Äîto both a synthetic dataset and a real-world rice seeds dataset. By minimizing an objective function, the study demonstrates how labeled data can guide label predictions for unlabeled instances, with performance measured in accuracy and computation time.

### Key Features

- **Semi-Supervised Learning**: Efficient label prediction for unlabeled data using a small set of labeled data.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Implementation of three optimization methods with convergence analysis and performance comparison.
- **Real-World Application**: Classification of rice seeds based on morphological attributes.

### Key Results

- **Convergence Behavior**: Gradient Descent converges in fewer iterations, while Gauss-Southwell BCGD is the fastest in terms of computational time.
- **Accuracy**: Achieved approximately 70% accuracy on true labels for the real rice seeds dataset, indicating effective label assignment.
- **Similarity Measure**: Exponential similarity (RBF kernel) yielded better performance compared to Euclidean distance for clustering.

### Data Overview

This project utilizes a synthetic dataset and a real-world rice seed dataset:

- **Rice Type Data Set**: [Rice Type Classification Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mssmartypants/rice-type-classification)  
  Contains attributes of rice grains, including area, perimeter, axis lengths, eccentricity, and convex area, used for classification between Jasmine and Gonen rice types.

### Methodology

The following optimization techniques were applied:

- **Gradient Descent**: Basic optimization technique with convergence based on gradient computation.
- **BCGD with Randomized Rule**: Coordinates updated based on random selection of blocks.
- **BCGD with Gauss-Southwell Rule**: Blocks are selected based on the direction of maximum gradient magnitude.

Additional methodology aspects include:

- **Similarity Measures**: RBF kernel used for calculating similarity weights between data points.
- **Stopping Criteria**: Convergence is determined by either a set iteration limit or the magnitude of the gradient.
